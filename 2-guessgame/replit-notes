Change theme by going to "User Settings" and "Themes". I much prefer the "Spooky" theme to the default dark theme as the greens on the latter hurt my eyes.

Scroll down on the "Tools" list in the left and go down to "User Settings". Disable "AI Code Repair", "AI Code Companion", "Use Advanced AI Model", and "Code Intelligence".
Hardcore mode: Also disable "Auto close brackets" and "Indentation detection".
Make sure "Indentation Character" is "spaces"!

Right click on console and "clear history" or just press the trash button next to it.

Don't worry if you accidentally closed the console, just click the plus icon and choose console from the list. OR fromt he bottom left "Tools" list, choose console.
Go to the three dot menu and click "Add Pane -> Insert Right" to add the console to the right again.
