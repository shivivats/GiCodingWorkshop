# Games Intersectional Coding Workshop Session 1

Find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lO-c6b-_i0710VYZUkxkbO7rI7nSgLk1szQhTPisgrE/edit?usp=sharing).

`1-hitpoints` contains the code for the "hit points" example used to illustrate how variables and conditionals work.

`2-guessgame` contains the code for the number-guessing game made during the session. The player plays against the PC to guess the number that the PC is thinking of. It illustrates the use of variables, conditionals, loops, random numbers, and input and output.

`3-text-based-adventure` contains the code for two kinds of text adventures, one with a while loop and one straightforward implementation with if-else statements. These were not covered in the session but you are free to go through and work with them!

Note: we used [GDB online Debugger](https://www.onlinegdb.com/) to run our code!
